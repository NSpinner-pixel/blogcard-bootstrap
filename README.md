# Blog Preview Card - Bootstrap Refactor

This is my refactored version of the Blog Preview Card project from Frontend Mentor.  
I switched out the custom CSS for Bootstrap’s utility classes and components to make the code cleaner, more consistent, and fully responsive.

## What I did  
 Used Bootstrap’s card component for layout  
 Replaced custom styles with Bootstrap’s text utilities  
 Made sure the card looks good on all screen sizes using Bootstrap 

Enjoy the code and let me know what you think.
